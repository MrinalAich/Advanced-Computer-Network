# Firewall based SDN Network
Staring with Firewall based SDN

## Introduction
In SDN Networks, the network intelligence is logically centralized in software-based controllers (the control plane), and network devices become simple packet forwarding devices (the data plane) that can be programmed via an open interface (OpenFlow).

## Firewall
SDN could be used to replace expensive Layer 4-7 firewalls, load-balancers, and IPS/IDS with cost-effective high-performance switches with a logically centralized controller.
In this project, I have implemented Layer 3 & 4 firewall by proactive policies and managed to block several applications like host-to-host connectivity and destination process.
